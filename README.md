# DaBurger

### Overview

In this assignment, we created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.
User can create desired burger and stage it in the list with all the burger. By pressing on `Devour it!` button user can imitate the consumption of that burger and it will be displayed in the Devoured list.
